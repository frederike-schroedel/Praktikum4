    \begin{section}{Plasmon}
        A plasmon is a resonant oscillation of the free electrons in a metal.
        In quantum mechanics they are considered the quasi particles, because
        they are a quantum of plasma oscillation, like a photon is a quasi
        particle of an electromagnetic wave.
        There are two different kinds of plasmons, surface plasmons and
        localized surface plasmons.
        You can observe surface plasmons in larger metal structures, but you
        need a smaller structure, at most half the size of the plasmon
        wavelength, to observe localized surface plasmons.  
        This experiment uses gold structures, for example periodically arranged
        discs with a size of a few nanometers.
        We observe them by examining the white light transmission spectrum of
        these samples.

    \begin{section}{Material}
        To put a set-up, that uses an external electro-magnetic field to excite
        localized surface plasmons, into effect, you need to fulfill the
        following conditions.

        We identify the discs with spheres in a vacuum, so the internal
        field is
        \begin{equation}
          \vec{E}_\text{int} = \vec E_0\frac{3\epsilon_d}
            {\epsilon_m+2\epsilon_d}
        \end{equation}
        $\vec E_\text{int}$ depends on the dielectric function of
        the material and therefore the resonance frequency also depends on it.
        We get the relation
        \begin{equation}
            \epsilon'_m = -2\epsilon_d
        \end{equation}
        which is fulfilled by silver and gold.
        The experiment uses gold, because it does not interact with hydrogen
        sulfide in the air.

    \begin{section}{Semi-classical model}
        Without an external electromagnetic field, the charge carriers in the
        gold sphere are homogeneously distributed.
        By applying such a field the electrons will move inside the sample, as
        you can see in \cref{fig:SemiClassical}. 
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
          \centering

            \label{fig:Phaseshift}
          \end{minipage}
        \end{figure}
        Due to this the distribution of the charge carriers has changed.
        If the external field oscillates, the electrons are oscillating, which
        leads to emission of electromagnetic radiation.
        Thus, we are getting a superposition of both fields.

        By using an oscillation of the external field close to the resonance
        frequency, we are able to excite the plasmons.
        For the resonant frequency the phase shifts by \SI{180}{\degree}.
        Because of the destructive interference, the transmitted intensity is
        reduced.
        The resonant frequency is mainly influenced by the restoring force
        and this in turn is influenced by the displacement of electrons,
        polarizability of the sample material and its surrounding medium.
        The restoring force and the displacement of electrons are related via
        a linear function.
        The sample reaches resonance, if the exciting radiation leads to standing
        waves inside. 
        Consequently the resonant wavelength changes equally with the samples
        dimensions.  

        We now observe ellipsoids, with their two different effects.
        If the stimulating radiation is polarized along the major axis, a longer
        axis will increase the wavelength of the transmission minimum.
        By changing to a perpendicular polarization, the transmission minimum
        shifts to a shorter wavelength.
        It is described by:
        \begin{equation}
            \alpha_i = \frac{V\epsilon_0}{L_I}\frac{1-\epsilon_m}
            {(1/L_i-1)+\epsilon_m}
        \end{equation}

    \begin{section}{Phase shift}
      \label{chp:TheoryPhaseshift}
      To illustrate the behavior of phase of two oscillations, we use a model
      of two excited harmonic oscillators. 
      In this model, a spring is connected
      to a motor on one side and a mass on the other. For exciting frequencies
      well below the resonance, the mass moves in phase with the motor.
      For increasing excitation frequencies the mass oscillates still with the
      same frequency but is delayed. The phase is shifted exactly
      $\SI{90}{\degree}$ at the resonant frequency as illustrated in
      \cref{fig:Phaseshift}. Increasing the excitation
      frequency over resonance shifts the phase up to $\SI{180}{\degree}$.

    \begin{section}{Coupling mechanisms}
      \label{chp:TheoryCoupling}
      Interactions between particle plasmons are called coupling.
      To be able to couple, two or more structures have to be close enough for
      their electric fields to interact with each other. 
      Two disks couple to each other as schematically shown in
      \cref{fig:Coupling}. This is just a graphical illustration, since
      the forces between the charges are not linear (as they would be with a
      spring) but proportional to $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$. For polarization along the
      axis connecting both disks, the charges inside the disks interact with
      each other in only one direction, resulting in a one dimensional net
      force. With perpendicular polarization, the forces act in different
      axes. The net forces change and result in an offset of the resonant
      frequency.

    \begin{section}{Damping mechanisms}
      \label{chp:TheoryDamping}
      Excited particle plasmons decay as a result of two different inner
      damping mechanisms. 
      
      \begin{description}
        \item[Damping \textit{with} emission of electromagnetic
        radiation:] By emitting electromagnetic radiation, the particle plasmon
        loses energy to its environment and decays.
        \item[Damping \textit{without} emission of electromagnetic
        radiation:] Oscillations inside the sample causes the energy of a
        particle plasmon to be turned into heat. Therefore the plasmon loses
        energy again and decays.
      \end{description}

    \begin{section}{Lattice effects}
      \label{chp:TheoryLatticeeffects}
      Since we will be observing samples with periodic lattices of structures,
      lattice effects such as deflection have to be considered. Electromagnetic
      radiation is not transmitted straight after interacting with a lattice.
      The periodic parameter of the lattice determines the degree of deflection
      the radiation encounters after being transmitted through that lattice.
      In the reciprocal space, this is defined by \textit{Bragg's law}
      (\cref{eq:Bragg}).
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:Bragg}
        \vec{G}=\vec{k_{s}}-\vec{k_{0}}.
      \end{equation}
      For this experiment we are mostly interested in the losses due to this
      effect, since we will be looking at transmitted intensity.
      With $|\vec{G}|=\frac{2\pi}{a}$ and
      $|\vec{k_{i}}|=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{i}}$ we get:
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2\pi}{a} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} =
        \begin{pmatrix} k_{s,x} \\ k_{s, y} \end{pmatrix} -
        \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ k_{0} \end{pmatrix}
      \end{equation}
      Relevant for us in this experiment is only the $x$-component:
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{2\pi}{a} = k_{s, x} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{s, x}},
      \end{equation}
      \begin{equation}
        \rightarrow a = \lambda_{s, x}.
      \end{equation}
      With $\lambda_{s, x}$ being the wavelength of the deflected wave missing
      in the transmission spectrum. By using a sample on a glass plate, we have
      to include the refraction of the glass of $n=1.5$ and therefore get:
      \begin{equation}
        \lambda = 1.5 \cdot a.
      \end{equation}

    \begin{section}{Oligomeric structures}
      \label{chp:TheoryOligomerics}
      Structures of multiple gold disks are called oligomeric structures and can
      arbitrarily complex, which in turn results in equally complex coupling
      effects. A rather simple example of such a complex structure would be a
      so called pentameric structure. It is composed of five gold disks arranged
      rotationally symmetric in a cross-like formation (\cref{fig:Pentamers}).

        \label{fig:Pentamers}
      \end{figure}
      
      
      
      \begin{subsection}*{Fano-Resonance}
        An asymmetrically formed spectrum is usually called a
        \textit{Fano-Resonance} and is the result of resonance effects of
        two very close resonant frequencies, with interfering eigenstates.
        If one observes a case of \textit{Fano-Resonance}, one can
        ultimately proof the existence of a second mode (\cref{fig:Fano}).
        \begin{figure}[ht!]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=.55\textwidth]{Figures/Fano.png}
          \caption{Spectrum with \textit{Fano-Resonance}.
          \cite{bib:Theorieteil}}
          \label{fig:Fano}
        \end{figure}
      \end{subsection}
      
      
      
      \begin{subsection}*{Modes}
        Modes describe oscillating eigenstates in systems capable of
        oscillations. This is of special relevance for this experiment, since we
        will be exciting plasmons, or static waves, inside the sample
        structures. Those modes can be observed by monitoring resonant
        frequencies in the visible electromagnetic spectrum.
        The pentameric structures in this experiment are going to be excited
        into two modes. The bright optical mode, which will always be visible
        to us, and the dark optical mode, which will never be visible.
        By varying the distances between the disks inside a pentameric
        structure it is possible to change the exact resonant frequency of both
        of these modes.
        A \textit{Fano-Resonance} can be observed, if the disks in the pentamers
        are close enough together for the eigenstates to degenerate and
        interfere with each other. Parts will be interfering constructively
        and others destructively to result in a spectrum with the a
        \textit{Fano-Resonance}.
        For the destructive interference, a part of the bright mode with a
        phase shift of more than $\SI{90}{\degree}$ interferes with a part of
        the dark mode with a phase shift of less than $\SI{90}{\degree}$.
        The modes then interfere constructively once both phase shifts are
        greater than $\SI{90}{\degree}$.

    \begin{section}{Adjusting the optical path}
      \label{chp:SetupOptics}
      To set up this experiment we started by aligning the light source to be
      parallel to the edges of our work plate and fixed it at a moderate height.
      Directly behind the light source in the optical path, we placed a lens
      with a focal length of $\SI{-100}{\milli\meter}$.
      
      From here on we will describe a lens and its orientation in the form of
      \textbf{lens ($\pm \SI{100}{\milli\meter}$)} where the number
      represents the focal length and the provided sign the orientation in
      relation to the optical path. "$-$" being the case that the focal point is
      in the optical path but \textbf{in front} of the lens pointing towards the
      source of light. And "$+$" being the opposite case of the focal point 
      being \textbf{behind} the lens i.e.\ further away from the light source.
      
      With the first lens placed roughly inside the path, we adjust the height
      of the beam by following it with a sharply pointed cone such that the
      middle of the beam is always the same height as the height-fixed cone.
      After the first lens is adjusted and fixed, we placed the second 
      lens ($+\SI{25.4}{\milli\meter}$) mounted on a 3D movable table in the
      beam and roughly adjust its height with the pre-fixed cone.
      Now, the beam has to be focused into a glass fiber, which we placed
      directly behind the lens ($+\SI{25.4}{\milli\meter}$) and adjust its
      height to be in the middle of the beam. Continuing the beam as shown in
      \cref{fig:Setup} we placed a lens ($\SI{-40}{\milli\meter}$) behind the
      other end of the glass fiber and another lens ($+\SI{200}{\milli\meter}$)
      behind that. Their height is calibrated using the cone and their position
      is adjusted such that their focal point is as sharp as possible and on the
      correct height.
      A double knife edge is placed directly in this focal point.
      
      Following the knife edge we placed a lens ($\SI{-50}{\milli\meter}$) to
      collimate the beam into a polarization plate we that we placed behind the
      lens. Both their heights are adjusted with the cone yet again.
      Now we placed the first lens system $(+)$ in the beam and fix it at the
      correct height. 
      Behind the first lens system $(+)$ we placed the sample and the second
      lens system $(-)$, which were both mounted on 3D tables.
      At this point we painfully noticed that, because of the layout we chose,
      we did not have enough space on the work plate to fix every component
      properly. And that we chose a height at which we did not have enough
      travel distance with the 3D tables to fully reach every part of the sample
      plate and adjust the beam correctly.
      Because of this initial design flaw we had to
      start over adjusting everything again to accommodate the limited
      travel distances of the 3D tables. 
      
      After we finished this and reached this point again, we placed a glass
      plate in the beam behind the second lens system $(-)$ and angled it to
      reflect a part of the beam into a CCD camera. In the section of the beam
      to the camera, we placed a lens ($+\SI{50}{\milli\meter}$) to focus the
      beam onto the camera chip. After adjusting the heights this beam branch
      was fixed.
      
      In the branch that was transmitted through the glass plate, we
      placed the last lens ($+\SI{40}{\milli\meter}$) which was mounted on
      another 3D table. After its height had been roughly adjusted we placed
      another glass fiber behind it and connected its other end to the
      spectrometer.
      
      At this point the building of the optical path was completed
      and we started calibrating the beam. To do so, we optimized the intensity
      received by the spectrometer by adjusting the
      lens ($+\SI{25.4}{\milli\meter}$) and the lens ($+\SI{40}{\milli\meter}$)
      on their 3D tables to focus the light as good as possible into the glass
      fibers. After the intensity was optimized, we adjusted both the
      double knife edge and the second lens system $(-)$ to project the knife edge
      as good as possible onto the CCD camera. To place the sample plate as good
      as possible in the focal points of the objectives, we moved the edge of
      glass in sight and adjusted this to be as sharp as possible on the CCD
      camera. 
      
      Now that the beam has been adjusted and optimized, we searched for the
      samples by moving the sample plate and placing the knife edges, such that
      only one sample was visible.
      With everything configured correctly, we moved the sample plate a little
      around to learn how the samples were arranged and to get an idea of the
      layout and the position we were actually looking at.

    \begin{section}{Taking measurements}
      \label{chp:SetupMeasuring}
      To start the actual collection of measurements we confirmed our starting
      position and mapped out a pattern by which we would go through all
      samples. Throughout the entire measuring phase, we often confirmed our
      current whereabouts on the sample plate to not confuse the measurements.
      Having established a pattern by which we would proceed, we adjusted the
      polarization plate to be at an angle of $\SI{0}{\degree}$ and also
      adjusted the intensity of the light source so that the spectrometer was
      not reaching its saturation.
      
      With everything now set up correctly we blocked the beam to measure the
      first \textit{dark spectrum}. We proceeded with taking measurements and
      taking \textit{reference spectra} at the beginning and after every two
      samples we measured. When taking the \textit{reference spectra}, we also
      checked if the sensor was reaching saturation. 
      
      We applied the same procedure to the measurements taken with the
      polarization plate set at $\SI{0}{\degree}$.

  \begin{chapter}{Analysis of the data}
    \label{chp:Analysis}
    When analyzing the spectra, we have to subtract the dark spectrum from
    all reference spectra to correct for any background light in the
    measurements.
    To analyze any recorded transmission spectrum, we plot the transmission
    spectra through a nano structure as percentage of the reference spectrum
    through glass alone without any nano structure.
    All this is done automatically by the software used in this experiment.
    Since we will mostly look for an minimum of transmission in the spectra,
    we show any plotted data series with a negative gaussian function already
    fitted. We use \cref{eq:TransspecFitting} as form of functions to be fitted
    to our data. For this equation, \textit{a, m} and \textit{$\sigma$} will be
    its degrees of freedom.
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:TransspecFitting}
      f(x)=100-a\cdot \exp\left(-\left(\frac{x-m}{\sqrt{2}\cdot\sigma}
      \right)^{2}\right)
    \end{equation}
    
    The distorted and noisy data points at the beginning and the end of the
    spectra will be ignored by us and are probably an effect of differing
    accuracy of counts within the spectrum  of the devices used by us.
    Perhaps the spectrometer is only most accurate in the range from
    $\SI{500}{\nano\meter}$ up to about $\SI{950}{\nano\meter}$ wavelengths.
    This hypothesis is backed up by the reference spectra we took 
    (\cref{Appendix:Data}).
    In those it is clear, that below a wavelength of $\SI{500}{\nano\meter}$
    and beyond one of $\SI{850}{\nano\meter}$, the number of counts through
    mere glass drops dramatically and well below of about $750$ counts per
    integrated measurement. This small amount of events seems to not be
    sufficient to provide a valid and accurate measure of the transmission
    percentage.
    We limit the range of values used to fit the negative
    gaussian function to a much smaller area to stabilize the fitting process.
    The fitted function therefore is only shown inside the range of values
    actually used to fit the function. 
    Additionally, it has to be said, that no data series has been changed by us
    in the process of making this report. The uncertainties for every fit
    parameters are provided by the fitting software used.
    In this case, we used \textit{Python} and the \texttt{curve\_fit} function
    from \texttt{scipy.optimize}.
    To make the development of each transmission minimum and its location
    easier to follow, we plotted them with regard to the varying parameter for
    each sample column. And to further illustrate any potential relations, we
    then added a fitted curve to those minima positions.
    For columns \textbf{A}, \textbf{D} and \textbf{E} it was to use a
    straight line, so we used a function with \cref{eq:gerade} as general form.
    For column \textbf{B} we used a function with \cref{eq:oneoverrsq} as
    general form.
    And finally for column \textbf{C} we used a second degree polynomial
    function with \cref{eq:parabola} as general form.
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:gerade}
      f(d) = m\cdot d + n
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:oneoverrsq}
      f(r) = \frac{a}{r^{2}}+b
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:parabola}
      f(x) = a\cdot x^{2} + b\cdot x + c
    \end{equation}

    \begin{section}{Column \textbf{A}: Disks with variable diameters}
      \label{chp:DataA}
      Column \textbf{A} contains four structures of simple disks in a constant
      lattice of $\SI{400}{\nano\meter}$ but varying the diameter of the disks
      for each structure. The recorded transmission spectra can be found in
      \cref{fig:TransspecFIT_APol0,fig:TransspecFIT_APol90}.
      In those graphics, one can observe how the resonating frequency of the
      structures change through the positions of their transmission minima.
      For larger diameters of disks, the resonating frequency shifts towards
      higher wavelengths and the blockage percentage increases.
      This effect is observable in the measurements for $\SI{0}{\degree}$ as
      well as for $\SI{90}{\degree}$ polarization. The relation between the
      changed parameter and the resulting change of resonant frequency seems to
      be linear, so we fitted a linear function to the positions.
      This linear relation (\cref{fig:MinimaPosA}) is expected by the
      semi-classical model, since the symmetrically and linear growing disks
      allow for an equally linear growing resonating wavelength. Since the
      disks are supposed to be round and symmetrical, we would also expect the
      two slopes to be equal, which we found not to be true with our
      measurements. Where a mutual slope is still within both ranges of
      error, we would also not expect this kind of offset between the two
      polarizations. In the semi-classical model we would expect both linear
      functions to be about the same. We can therefore only suspect that
      some other factor involved might have changed the outcome of our
      measurements. Maybe the disks might be of equal size and shape, but the
      shape of the lattice they are arranged in differs in both directions.
      Or it could be due to some kind of refraction effect along the optical
      path, which could shift the wavelengths to higher or lower values.
      It could also be that the dimensions of the lattice are not symmetrical
      in both directions and therefore the net forces between the disks are
      different for both polarizations.

    \begin{section}{Column \textbf{B}: Dimers with variable mid-to-mid
        distances}
      \label{chp:DataB}
      Column \textbf{B} contains nine structures of dimers with constant
      diameters of $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ and lattice of
      $\SI{670}{\nano\meter}$ mid-to-mid but varying mid-to-mid positions. From
      \cref{fig:TransspecFIT_BPol0,fig:TransspecFIT_BPol90}, it possible to see
      different responses of the resonant frequency for two different
      polarizations. In the case of $\SI{0}{\degree}$ polarization, the
      resonating wavelengths are shifted to smaller values with a growing
      mid-to-mid distance in the dimers. Furthermore, the distance of each
      shift decreases with every step of increased mid-to-mid distance.
      For the $\SI{90}{\degree}$ polarization the resonating frequency shifts
      in the other direction, but it is still decreasing with every sample.
      There is however, a difference in blocked intensity for both
      polarizations. Whereas all transmission values at $\SI{0}{\degree}$
      polarization are below $\SI{60}{\percent}$ the transmitted intensity
      at $\SI{90}{\degree}$ polarization is between $\SI{60}{\percent}$ and 
      $\SI{70}{\percent}$.

      The semi-classical model predicts for this experiment a relation of the
      form of \cref{eq:oneoverrsq}. Fitting a curve of this form we notice,
      that this kind of relation describes our data very well for both
      polarizations. Only the first data point of $\SI{0}{\degree}$ polarization
      seems to be a little off. Fitting the function without this measurement,
      the curve describes the progression even better.

    \begin{section}{Column \textbf{C}: Disks with variable period}
      \label{chp:DataC}
      Column \textbf{C} contains nine structures of dimers with constant
      diameters of $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ but this time varying period
      mid-to-mid distances.
      From looking at the plotted spectra, it is not very obvious to see any
      pattern other than a change in transmitted intensity.
      Plotting positions of the transmission minima, it is much easier to
      observe some kind of relation between the changed parameters.

      Theory predicts for this case the relation to be of a second degree 
      polynomial function, due to the forces between the electric fields being
      proportional to $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$.
      Fitting a second degree polynomial function to our measured values
      displays a reasonable good fit for the polarization at $\SI{90}{\degree}$.
      For the case of $\SI{0}{\degree}$ polarization, this form of function
      should also fit, but seems to be a rather vague assumption and does not
      fit as well as for $\SI{90}{\degree}$ polarization.
      Additionally, both function have their minimum set off by about
      $\SI{20}{\nano\meter}$. This offset is the result of different net forces
      between charges for both polarizations as described in
      \cref{chp:TheoryCoupling}.

    \begin{section}{Column \textbf{D}: Pentamers with variable mid-to-mid
        distances}
      \label{chp:DataD}
      Column \textbf{D} contains five structures of pentamers with a constant
      lattice of $\SI{900}{\nano\meter}$ and disk diameter of
      $\SI{140}{\nano\meter}$ but varying mid-disk-to-mid-disk distances.
      Again, only by looking at the measured spectra it is very difficult to
      make out any kind of relation between the mid-disk-to-mid-disk distances
      and the position of the transmission minima. Fitting the negative gaussian
      functions and plotting their dip positions however is far more revealing.
      Except for the first data point in the $\SI{0}{\degree}$ polarization
      series and the third data point in the $\SI{90}{\degree}$ series, both
      sample columns follow a linear progression. This is exactly what the
      theory predicts for this case. Due to the symmetry of the pentamers and
      the symmetrical changes applied to them, their resonant frequency
      responses similar to the resonance of a single disk. 

      The two points that do not follow this linear function are probably a
      result of some kind of instability during the fitting operation and not
      of much relevance.

      Just like in \cref{chp:DataA} both slopes should be about the same and
      they do match with both their ranges of error. Exactly like before in
      \cref{chp:DataA}, their appears to be some kind of effect which offsets
      both linear progressions only this time by about half the distance it
      was set off in \cref{chp:DataA}. Since the sample did not consist of
      Dimers but instead of symmetrical Pentamers, this offset was not predicted
      by the theory and must be the result of another effect.

    \begin{section}{Column \textbf{E}: Ellipses with variable length of
        major axis}
      \label{chp:DataE}
      Column \textbf{E} contains eight structures of Ellipses with a constant
      lattice of $\SI{750}{\nano\meter}$ and disk diameter
      $\delta_{x} = \SI{140}{\nano\meter}$ but varying disk diameter
      $\delta_{y}$. 

      By stretching the sample disk in one direction and forming it into an
      elliptic shape the resulting resonant frequency changes, with polarization
      parallel to the stretched axis, almost like it would for a normal disk
      in \cref{chp:DataA}. In this polarization direction the changes appear
      again to be related by a linear function. But since the disk is elongated
      in only one direction, the other one stays of exactly the same length.
      In symmetrically round disks one would expect the resonant frequency to
      stay exactly the same in this polarization, but for elliptical shapes it
      shifts slowly towards smaller wavelengths. This is, of course due to the
      elliptical shape in which the distribution of charges is not as even as it
      would be in a perfectly round shaped disk. This allows the charges to
      rearrange themselves faster and results in a higher resonating frequency
      and therefore a smaller wavelength.

      Looking at \cref{fig:TransspecFIT_EPol0,fig:TransspecFIT_EPol90} it
      becomes clear that the resonant wavelength in the $\SI{0}{\degree}$
      polarization case already leaves the accurate range of wavelengths and
      even leave the measured range all together.
      The data points in this region seem to be very distorted, unclear and
      the fitting routine was not always able to get an accurate fix on the
      minima locations as shown by the very large ranges of error. Because of
      this, we ignored the second to last data point in the $\SI{0}{\degree}$
      series, which would have been at a wavelength of around
      $\SI{18000}{\nano\meter}$. Looking beyond this minor technical problem,
      it is easy to see from the fitted function in \cref{fig:MinimaPosE},
      that in reality the resonant frequency behaves just like the theory
      suggested it would.

      \label{chp:AnalysisSummary}
      During this experiment we were able to confirm that the resonant frequency
      of a plasmon is blocked in the transmission spectrum.
      We could also see how the resonant frequency changed in response to the
      changing dimensions of the sample and that those changes were correctly
      predicted by the semi-classical model.

      We encountered only one unresolved problem by finding an offset in the
      fitted functions for the two different polarizations we observed.
